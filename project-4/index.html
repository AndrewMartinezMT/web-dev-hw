      <h1>What is Responsive Web Desgin?</h1>

      <p>Responsive Web Design is a way of desgining websites to be supported
        on different devices as well as different browser types. Responsive
        Web Design allows the content of a website to be uniform across all
        platforms, whether someone is viewing your site on a smartphone of a
        desktop.

      <div class="flex-item whyuse">
        <h1>Why use Responsive Web Design?</h1>

        <p>Designers shoudl use a Responsive Web Design approach. Using Responsive Web Design is important because it allows for the website
          to be viewed on different types of platforms without the sacrifice of
          erasing, moving, or rearranging the content of the website. A business,
          university, or media streaming website would want to use Responsive Web
          Design because people are using different types of devices to access the
          websites. Using Responsive Web Desgin would allow users to be free to use
          any device they would like.
        </p>

        <div class="flex-item process">
          <h1>Process</h1>
          <p>The process for creating a website with a Responsive Web Desgin approach
            is quite simple. If you already know some basics on web desgin, it should
            come quickly to you. Within your  Style CSS file, each 'box', should be designated
            in a specific order. You must then order each 'box' in order to align each
            'box' within a specific order. Then, in the Style sheet, designatethe media
            screen minimum pixels and the order the 'boxes' will show up on smaller screens.
            Flexbox is suitable for Responsive Web Design because it allows the text to grow
            or shrink depending on the space available on the webpage. Wireframes play a
            role in Responsive Web Design because it allows web developers to make a template
            and see exactly how their website will look once there is content on the page.

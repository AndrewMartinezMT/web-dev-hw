# Project 2

## "Instructable"

### Part 1 of 3
This part of the project is about making an ordered list of a craft, a cooking recipe, or an academic lesson.
For this project I will provide a step by step tutorial of how to tie a fly. <p>The fly I will provide a lesson for is the <strong>notorious</strong> <em>olive</em> wooly bugger.</p>

This project will be fun for me since I love tying my own flies. <p>It will be awesome to provide a lesson to tie one of the most <strong><em>versatile</strong></em> flies.</p>

### Part 2 of 3
This part of the project included providing images, text boxes, buttons, and other elements that make up a web page. This part of the project took a little longer than expected.


### Part 3 of 3
This portion of the project was interesting. Incorporating videos and audio into my own website was awesome. I am still struggling a little writing out the code properly but I keep learning as I go on.

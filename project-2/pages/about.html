<p>Hey everyone. My name is Andrew Martinez and I am a Resource
    Conservation major with a minor in Fire Sciences/Management.
    This is my first time taking a web design class and so far it
    has been an awesome learning experience.</p>
<p>I chose the topic of tying flies for this project because I love to
  fly fish. I started tying my own flies a year ago, taught myself the
  basics, and now I tie most of my own. It is satisfying to catch a fish
  on something I made myself. It is also very relaxing to tie flies.</p>
<p>I moved to Missoula for school three years ago and have never thought
  about going back home. I love living here and I am able to enjoy being
  outside, usually hunting or fishing. I graduate this semester and haven't
  been more exicted to finish school and continue working my dream job:
  a firefighter for the Forest Service.</p>

# Project 3: The Literature Showcase

This project has been somewhat of a challenge for me. I believe I have the basics of desgining a webpage that functions the way actual webpages work. However, it is a challenge to incorporate new skills and things that I learn from the class. Coding is a lot of work and I appreciate anyone who does it for a living because of the amount of time and pain it may take.

## Color Choices
The reason I chose the colors on my webpage was to give a little bit of a nature feel to my page with a forestry green backgroung color.

## Introduction
I chose this book because I am fond of everything about forestry and wildfires. Being a wildland firefighter myself, I love to read anything about it. In my opinion, this book is a great read for anyone with a desire to learn a little about wildland fire and curiosity about smokejumpers.

## Sample
I chose those quotes from the book because they were the most powerful quotes in the book in my opinion.

## Format of Webpage
I chose the format of the webpage because I like the way it flows. I chose the solid boarders because I think they look more asthetically pleasing.

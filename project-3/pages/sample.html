        <p>"There's the satisfaction of facing huge physical and mental challenges.
          The undeniable excitement of danger. The camaraderie, and the love/hate
          relationship that comes from depending on others for your life and vice
          versa."-Jason A. Ramos pg 212

          "This job is notorious for the strain it puts on relationships. Dating a
          firefighter or smokejumper sounds exciting, and in the short term often is.
          But the appeal of your partner being called away constantly to do dangerous
          work at a moments notice, to who knows where and for who knows how long,
          quickly wears thin."-Jason A. Ramos pg 211</p>
